## Communication strategy

Our primary message is to positively challenge all Manchester Metropolitan University students on their contribution to climate change and act in reducing their environmental impact upon the earth.

Our initiative will be unique in that it will be the first Manchester based Eco website that collates data and tips from a wide range of sources and present these in consumable and easy to digest formats for our audience. This will deliver synthesis with Manchester Metropolitan University’s dedication to reduce the impact of the university and its members upon the environment. 

The site will use simplistic branding and clear tonality to present the data to our audience, in a non-judgemental way. It will importantly champion and illustrate to we use eco-friendly coding and site hosting, to ensure that the impact of the website is as limited as possible.
