# Usability Testing

## Submission Point Four

In SP4 each team undertakes a usability testing session, self-managed, but overseen by tutors. The output is a report produced for SP5.

**First - [Read through the instructions](#instructions)**

## Instructions

### About

Submission Point 4 is a chance for your team to conduct remote usability testing.

You should now have reached the stage where you have a basic design, content and structure for your `guide` web site. The group is now required to carry out usability testing and to get feedback on the success or failures of your current version, so that you can incorporate this feedback into your site design.

Feedback from someone outside of your team can be invaluable to improve your work. It may highlight errors or inconsistencies; it may raise issues you had not previously noted. It might also confirm that you are doing (at least some) things right.

### Essential Documents

- [Usability Test Instructions](ux-testing/usability_test_instructions.md).
- [Usability Test tips & advice](ux-testing/usability_testing_tips.md).

### How does this work?

Each team will have to record evidence of their usability testing. This may be a photograph or video of the usability test taking place, or notes taken as the test runs.

### Assessment

You will be assessed on your preparation and execution of the usability testing session (as per the [marking schedule](marksheets/sp4-marksheet.docx) ). A tutor will support you.

## SP4 Planning document

Use the planning document to prepare and record the meeting.

## The brief - User testing script

You are required to develop a method for your test session. This may be face to face or remote.

**Ensure that any Government advice on social distancing or other COVID-19 related requirements is followed.**

## Usability testing consent form

Customise the consent form (provided) for your test candidate to sign. This should include permission to record the session including video, audio and their actions on screen.

> Document: [consent form template document](ux-testing/consent_form.md). Amend and print for the test session.

After the test session scan the signed document to `jpg`. This will be added to [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md).

## (Post test) exit survey

Create a simple exit survey (5 or 6 questions) to get further feedback from your test candidate. You can use Microsoft Forms to do this.

The survey should be given to the test candidate (in paper form) at the end of the test session. Ask them to leave the room and to complete the survey before they leave.

Use the results from the survey as part of your report. After the test session scan the signed document to `pdf`. Add to [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md).

---

## Notes

During the test sessions you should be taking notes that you can share with the group.

Use the [MSWord Mini User Journey](UX-testing/Mini-User-Journey.docx) form to record your notes/observations during your usability testing session (and any subsequent sessions).

This form provides structure to your note taking. <!--  Prepare for the session: - Create a version of this form for each of your core tasks tasks (after the general walk through),entering the steps you expect the user to take, to attain their goal. - Print a number of copies of each task for the note takers. Note takers should complete the form, making notes of their observations during the session. -->

> When completed, scan the notes to a single `pdf` document and add to the [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md).

<!-- ---

## Test session video

We will capture the test session for you (screen, voice and face). After the sessions we will process the videos and make them available on Moodle for you review.

Reviewing the video will help you better understand the results of your testing.

You can use screenshots from the video as part of your [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md). -->

## Usability Testing Report

Using the template provided to develop a report on the test sessions and any further testing carried out during the project.

Any good UX report should answer the following questions:

1. What did you do?
1. Why did you do it?
1. How did you do it?
1. What did you find?
1. What are you going to do about it (ie how will it be brought back into the design/process)?

**All further testing should be detailed, evidenced (photographs) and include signed consent forms for any further test candidates**.

Always make clear any issues (support with images, screenshots etc).

Your usability testing report should collect all the data your group has found about your page design and indicate which data points need to be incorporated into the iterated page design.

Your usability testing report should then present an updated version of your page design that shows the insights you have gained from carrying out the user testing.
